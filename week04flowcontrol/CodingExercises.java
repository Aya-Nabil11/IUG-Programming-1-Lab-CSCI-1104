//        You are given a program that gets three inputs from the user, op (char), n1 (int) and n2 (int).
//
//        Your task is to add code which initialize new variable res (int) which will hold the following:
//
//        if op equals to '+', res will hold n1 + n2.
//
//        else if op equals to '-', res will hold n1 - n2. 
//
//        else if op equals to '*', res will hold n1 * n2.
//
//        else res will hold 0.



// ask the user to enter 3 numbers and print the largest one





//Write a program that asks the user for a password and checks if it's at least 8 characters long.
//
//If yes, print "Strong password"
//If no, print "Password too short"
//Expected Output:
//Enter password: hello
//Password too short
//
//Enter password: hello123
//Strong password




//Question 7: String Length Comparison
//Write a program that takes two strings and tells which one is longer.
//Expected Output:
//Enter first string: cat
//Enter second string: elephant
//The second string is longer






//Question 13: Character Position Finder
//Write a program that finds if a character exists in a string using indexOf().
//If found, print its position; if not found, print "Not found".
//Expected Output:
//Enter text: Hello
//Enter character to find: l
//Character found at position: 2
//
//Enter text: Hello
//Enter character to find: x
//Not found







//Question 17: Strong Password Validator
//Write a program that checks if a password is strong:
//
//At least 8 characters long
//Contains at least one uppercase letter
//Contains at least one digit
//
//Expected Output:
//Enter password: Hello123
//Strong password!
//
//Enter password: hello
//Weak password



//Question 31: Advanced Password Strength Checker
//Write a program that rates password strength:
//
//Weak: Less than 8 characters
//Medium: 8-12 characters with letters only
//Strong: 8-12 characters with letters and digits
//Very Strong: More than 12 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and digits
//
//Expected Output:
//Enter password: abc
//Weak password
//
//Enter password: Hello123World
//Very Strong password



// Enter a name and dicide if it is start with ca[ital letter or not

//- Child: age < 13
//  - Teenager: age 13-19
//  - Adult: age 20-59
//  - Senior: age >= 60

//- leap year


//Question 22: BMI Calculator with Categories
//Write a program that:
//
//Takes weight (kg) and height (meters)
//Calculate BMI = weight / (height * height)
//Uses IF-ELSE IF-ELSE to categorize:
//
//Underweight: < 18.5
//Normal: 18.5 - 24.9
//Overweight: 25 - 29.9
//Obese: >= 30
//
//
//Uses nested IF inside each category to give specific advice
//
//Required: Arithmetic operators, IF-ELSE IF-ELSE, Nested IF

        System.out.println(x++ + ++x);
